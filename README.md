Mobile Sales & Pricing Strategy Dashboard (Power BI)

This project analyzes how pricing, discounts, customer ratings, and device features impact mobile phone sales performance across major brands — Apple, Samsung, Realme, Xiaomi, and Poco.
The dashboard focuses on business decision insights rather than only sales reporting. It demonstrates how data can be used for pricing strategy, brand positioning, and product planning in the consumer electronics market.

Problem Statement

Retailers and brands often struggle to understand:
Do higher discounts really increase sales?
Which price band contributes the most revenue?
What features (RAM, Battery) drive customer purchase decisions?
How do ratings influence brand positioning and sales?
Which brands win in premium vs value-for-money segments?

This dashboard answers these questions using data-driven analysis.
