# Mobile-Sales-Pricing-Strategy-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
This project goes beyond basic sales reporting and focuses on business decision insights that brands and retailers can actually use for pricing, positioning, and product strategy.
I built this end-to-end Power BI dashboard to analyze how pricing, discounts, customer ratings, and features influence mobile sales performance across major brands like Apple, Samsung, Realme, Xiaomi, and Poco.
Key Business Insights

• Realme emerges as the top performer in overall sales and revenue, dominating the mid-range market.
• Redmi Note series leads in unit sales, showing strong customer preference for balanced price and features.
• Apple generates lower sales volume but higher revenue per unit due to premium pricing.
• Higher discounts do not always result in higher sales — perceived value and features matter more.
• The ₹30K+ price band contributes the highest revenue, confirming the profitability of premium devices.
• 6GB RAM and higher battery capacity models drive the strongest sales, highlighting performance-driven buying behavior.
• Apple has the highest average customer ratings, reflecting superior perceived quality.
• Realme and Xiaomi lead in the value-for-money segment, balancing pricing and demand.

What this dashboard demonstrates

• Advanced DAX measures for KPI engineering
• Price sensitivity and discount effectiveness analysis
• Brand positioning using price vs rating vs sales
• Feature impact analysis (RAM, Battery, Price Band)
• Business storytelling through interactive visuals

This project helped me explore how data can guide pricing strategy, product positioning, and market targeting in the consumer electronics industry.
